# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app allows users to post tweets and see them on a live updating feed. It was built using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, and CSS for the front end. It also uses Express and Node for the back end. The app has a responsive layout and features animations / smooth transitions.
